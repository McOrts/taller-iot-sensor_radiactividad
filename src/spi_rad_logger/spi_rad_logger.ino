/*Serial Communication for Radiation Detector Arduino Compatible DIY Kit ver 2.01 or higher
* http://radiohobbystore.com/radiation-detector-geiger-counter-diy-kit-second-edition.html
* Allow to connect the kit to computer and use the kit with Radiation Logger PC software
* http://radiohobbystore.com/radiation-logger/
* This Arduino sketch written by Alex Boguslavsky RH Electronics; mail: support@radiohobbystore.com
* CPM counting algorithm is very simple, it just collect GM Tube events during presettable log period.
* For radiation monitoring station it's recommended to use 30-60 seconds logging period. Feel free to modify
* or add functions to this sketch. This Arduino software is an example only for education purpose without any
* warranty for precision radiation measurements. You are fully responsible for your safety in high
* radiation area!!
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* WHAT IS CPM?
* CPM (or counts per minute) is events quantity from Geiger Tube you get during one minute. Usually it used to 
* calculate a radiation level. Different GM Tubes has different quantity of CPM for background. Some tubes can produce
* about 10-50 CPM for normal background, other GM Tube models produce 50-100 CPM or 0-5 CPM for same radiation level.
* Please refer your GM Tube datasheet for more information. Just for reference here, SBM-20 can generate 
* about 10-50 CPM for normal background.
* --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* HOW TO CONNECT GEIGER KIT?
* The kit 3 wires that should be connected to Arduino UNO board: 5V, GND and INT. PullUp resistor is included on
* kit PCB. Connect INT wire to Digital Pin#2 (INT0), 5V to 5V, GND to GND. Then connect the Arduino with
* USB cable to the computer and upload this sketch.
